# BootstrAPI Project

## Overview
BootstrAPI is a front-end web application that showcases two main functionalities: a Random Dog Image Generator and a Weather App. It leverages external APIs to fetch and display data, and uses Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing interface. This was my first project at Code Immersives. 

### Features
- **Random Dog Image Generator**: Fetches and displays random dog images from an external API.
- **Weather App**: Allows users to enter a city name and displays the current weather details fetched from a weather API.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.
